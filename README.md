## Problem:
What sucks about college?

## Our Problem:
Class Registration SUCKS!

## Our solution (in a nutshell)
Our goal with our solution is to make class registration easier and make information about class requirements, graduation requirements, major specific & minor specific class information etc. more transparent. Another goal to our app is to cut out the middle men / women of class advisors and have the information that they give to us all accessable with easy to maneuver through UI.
